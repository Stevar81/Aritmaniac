**Testing Document**

I tested classes in logic- and actors packages. There isn't so much testing in gui and graphics because you can see instantly if something goes wrong with them. For me listeners were easier to test manually than trying to create artificial key strokes.

Things I tested:
- Answer to division task is always non-negative integer and denominator is never zero.
- Correct answers mach to questions
- The format of question is correct
- There are right kind of operators in each level
- The magnitude of numbers is correct in each level
- The points and level matches the ongoing situation
- Points are increased and decreased correctly
- Game-class return the correct player's name
- Levels are set correctly
- The operator is some of the four characters: +, -, *, /
- Players' points comparator works
- Information from the text file is read correctly
- Players array is in order based on the points
