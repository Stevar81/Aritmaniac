**Instructions**

- First you give your name which can contain only letters and can be 1-9 characters long.
- Press Space to start, F1 to watch the highscore-list or Esc to quit.
- After starting the game you have 100 seconds to answer as many calculations as you can.
  You will reach a new level after every five consecutive right answers. A wrong answer will 
  bring you to start of the level so that you will loose all the points you earned from that
  level and will need five right answers again to reach a new level.
  The number of points you get from the right answer is same as the current level.
  The relative share of harder tasks will increase as you reach new levels.
- When the game is over, you will be informed if you've reached the top ten or not.
- Then you can start a new game by pressing enter or if someone else wants to play, you can
  press M to go to the menu to give another name. You can also watch the top ten list again or
  quit.
